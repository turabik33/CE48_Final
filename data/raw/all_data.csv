2ab52badbadab1320c2b1838b4aa7446,"Faulty engineering led to deadly Titan sub implosion, US investigators rule",2025-10-15T23:23:39Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/titan-sub-disaster-ntsb-report,"The deadly implosion of a submersible traveling to the wreck of the Titanic was the result of faulty engineering, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced on Wednesday. The NTSB’s final report on the voyage that killed five people in June 2023 said that OceanGate, the private company that owned the Titan, did not adequately test its experimental submersible before the trip. The Washington state-based firm, which suspended operations after the catastrophic implosion, was unaware of the submersible’s true durability, the report said. The victims, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, died instantly in the North Atlantic during the descent to the remains of the Titanic. The implosion also killed French underwater explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, known as “Mr Titanic”; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood. The Titan’s defective engineering “resulted in the construction of a carbon fiber composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements”, the NTSB said. The safety board also said OceanGate had not followed standard guidance for emergency responses, and that the Titan could have been found sooner if it had. If the company had abided by expected protocols, it would have saved “time and resources”, the report said, while noting “rescue was not possible in this case”. The report was also critical of the culture at the company, quoting a former operations technician who had raised alarms about potential coast guard regulations prior to the implosion. That technician had questioned the company’s choice to call paying passengers “mission specialists”, prompting the CEO to respond that “if the Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away”, the report said, citing the technician. The NTSB report dovetails with a coast guard report released in August that described the Titan implosion as preventable. The coast guard determined that safety procedures at OceanGate were “critically flawed” and found “glaring disparities” between safety protocols and actual practices. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Wednesday. In August, after the coast guard report was released, a company spokesperson offered condolences to the families of those who died. The Titan’s implosion led to lawsuits and to calls for tighter regulation of private deep-sea expeditions. The NTSB report suggested current regulations for small passenger vessels such as the Titan were inadequate and had “enabled OceanGate’s operation of the Titan in an unsafe manner”. The safety board recommended the coast guard establish a panel of experts to study submersibles and implement updated regulations. The report also called on the coast guard to “disseminate findings of the study to the industry”, which has grown in recent years as privately financed exploration has grown. The vessel had been making voyages to the Titanic site since 2021. Its final dive came on the morning of 18 June 2023. The submersible lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later and was reported overdue that afternoon. A multiday search for survivors off Canada made international headlines. It soon became clear there would be no survivors, and the coast guard and other authorities began lengthy investigations into what had happened. The sub disaster was the subject of a Netflix documentary released earlier this year.",Sam Levin and agencies,World news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.220645Z,news
adaf0bec47e41df9631a09f66db9c0c0,‘An engineering feat’: the 26-year-old Australian making costumes for Lady Gaga,2025-11-28T14:00:09Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/fashion/2025/nov/29/an-engineering-feat-the-26-year-old-australian-making-costumes-for-lady-gaga,"It starts in a flood of red: a red-curtained stage, red flashing lights. It’s Lady Gaga, so theatrics are par for the course. As the lights go up it becomes clear she’s not standing on a giant stage but, in fact, wearing it. A militaristic bodice extends into the swooping velvet drapes of a 7.5-metre-high gown. “It’s not just a dress; it’s a moving piece of art, an engineering feat,” says the Australian-Taiwanese designer Samuel Lewis, who dreamed up its design, and created it in collaboration with the LA-based costume designer Athena Lawton. The extent of the costume only becomes apparent when Gaga’s skirt opens to reveal a metal cage underneath, with dancers writhing and reaching behind its steel bars. Lewis had to push his limits to dream of – and achieve – this design. “We had to be like, how giant can something like this be?” Gaga’s five-star, full-blooded return to OTT camp, the Mayhem Ball tour, isn’t the first time that she and the 26-year-old designer have worked together. Aside from designing all the looks in the tour’s first act, Lewis dressed her for the 2025 Grammys, and for the music videos for Disease (a grey illusion gown made of hand-dyed silk, for a sense of decomposition) and Abracadabra (a red-boned silk dress that plays to Lewis’s love of corsetry). Since graduating from Florence’s Polimoda in 2024, Lewis has quickly become known among celebrity circles for bringing together meticulous engineering and a kind of chaotic, grungy romanticism; a mix that makes his work feel kinetic and disciplined. He throws himself into complicated construction – Russian-doll dresses within dresses, impeccably boned corsets, pieces that move, fit together and transform into other things. These pieces have to work, to bear weight and withstand exertion on a stage. Designing for beauty is one thing; designing to survive a performance is wholly another. Other celebrities who have taken notice of his work include Chappell Roan, members of Blackpink, Julia Fox and Madonna. He’s designing Christina Aguilera’s Christmas-special look, too. Lewis brushes off the suggestion that he’s precociously talented, preferring instead to talk about his spider’s web of influences. His cultural diet moves in “waves” but film is a big part of it. Right now he is hooked on Only Lovers Left Alive, Jim Jarmusch’s Tilda Swinton-led film from 2013 about vampires who have been alive a little too long, set across Tangier and Detroit.

96f60eb74228218fb4da703d5d6b3301,Leading conservationists just decided that genetically engineering wild animals is OK – sometimes. They’re right,2025-10-23T12:15:06Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/23/conservationists-genetically-engineering-wild-animals-dna-lab,"Do you think we should genetically modify wildlife? What if we could make seabirds resistant to the flu that has been exterminating them en masse, just by tweaking their DNA a smidgen? Or make fish that can shrug off pollution, or coral that can survive warming waters? Engineer in the sorts of change that could occur naturally, given enough time, if only the wildlife would stop dying already. Thanks to newly emerging methods, such as Crispr, these feats are within reach. Recently, conservationists met at the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) 2025 World Conservation Congress where they debated GM wildlife and voted on a proposed moratorium that would stymie their release into the wild. Ahead of the meeting, a group of more than 90 NGOs issued a press release urging the IUCN to “say no to engineered wild species.” But humans have been altering the DNA of other species for millennia. It all began about 30,000 years ago, when our species started to domesticate wild animals. When we invited them into our world, slowly but surely, the grey wolf morphed into the dog, the red jungle fowl transformed into the chicken and the aurochs gave way to domestic cattle. Then, a few hundred years ago, people started to deliberately breed their most desirable animals together. By repeating the process across generations, key features became exaggerated. Cattle became meatier. Pigs became longer. Dogs took on distinctive features which are now identifiable as dachshunds, dalmatians and dobermans. Selective breeding, as it is known, led to the creation of hairless cats, goldfish with quiffs and goats that faint when they are surprised. No kidding. All of these features are underpinned by changes to the animals’ DNA. We may not have modified their genetics by design, but when we select for specific characteristics, the related DNA sequences hitch along for the ride. Over time, this leads to genetic change. It doesn’t stop there, however. As I point out in my book, Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on Earth, human activity is now altering the DNA of all life on Earth. Before our species evolved, life was shaped by natural forces. Evolution and the genetic change that goes with it tended to happen slowly across many millennia. Now, as we warm our world, pollute our planet and destroy the few wild places we have left, we are causing evolution to accelerate. Genetic change is being witnessed on timescales of decades and centuries. Central Park’s white-footed mice have acquired versions of genes that help them to process fatty foods and a fungus found on mouldy nuts. It seems they have evolved the ability to eat pizza and peanuts. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, American cliff swallows have evolved smaller wings to help them dodge traffic, and in Puerto Rico, crested anole lizards have evolved longer legs and stickier toes to help them cling to buildings. If altering the DNA of wild species is a line you feel should never be crossed, then I have news for you. That ship sailed long ago. Although the hi-tech methods of today’s scientists may be different, the end result – modified organisms with new characteristics and subtly different DNA – is the same. New technologies often spawn anxiety. When Robert Bakewell, the 18th-century agriculturalist who championed selective breeding, began his work with farm animals, critics said it was unnatural and potentially dangerous. The same concerns were later raised with Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards as they pioneered the development of IVF in the 70s. In the 90s, cloning expert Ian Wilmut received similarly short shrift when he unveiled the birth of Dolly the sheep. Then, selective breeding turned out to be useful. IVF led to the creation of happy, healthy babies. And cloning became adopted by the agricultural industry, which uses it to replicate elite breeding animals. Sometimes, methods that are initially perceived as new, artificial and unnerving, become accepted over time as they become familiar and are proven to be safe and helpful. The deliberate genetic modification of wildlife could be one of these methods. Those who raised their concerns at the IUCN conference were right to do so. One way that gene editing differs from traditional breeding methods is that it can be used to introduce entirely novel characteristics. For example, scientists have taken genes from jellyfish and coral and added them to zebrafish, to create fluorescent versions of the popular aquarium pets. Genes from different species can be mixed and matched, so it’s important to decide which changes are acceptable and which are off limits. New methods also have the potential to alter DNA, not just at the individual level, but at the population level too. A technique called gene drive rewrites the traditional laws of inheritance by ensuring that a particular gene gets passed down to all offspring, rather than the usual half. This can be used to quickly spread helpful features, such as disease resis",Helen Pilcher,Opinion,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.220791Z,news
007063e79236e8c725a8ec9ad6fdfe6b,Senior DWP civil servant blames victims for carer’s allowance scandal,2025-12-07T14:50:51Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/06/senior-dwp-civil-servant-blames-victims-for-carers-allowance-scandal,"One of the most senior civil servants in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has placed the blame for the carer’s allowance benefits crisis on victims, many of whom have been left with life-changing debts. In an internal blogpost written for Whitehall colleagues, Neil Couling, the director general of DWP services, said individual failings by carers were “at the heart” of the issue that has been likened to the Post Office Horizon scandal. The post, which was removed after the Guardian made inquiries about its content, has been met with an outcry by charities and politicians. An independent review into the scandal last month found that longstanding and “unacceptable” systemic DWP leadership problems and poor benefit design were at the root of the failure, which it said could not be blamed on carers. Some carers who fell foul of the benefit’s outdated and complex rules felt so shamed, distressed and desperate they contemplated suicide, the review found. It described being caught in the system as like being “at the whim of a faceless machine”. The review, by the disability rights expert Liz Sayce, concluded that senior DWP leaders had for a decade failed to grip or fix problems with the benefit, despite repeated warnings by whistleblowers, auditors and MPs. Couling’s post said one of the main causes of overpayments was as a result of the DWP’s “rather byzantine” guidance on the averaging of carer’s earnings. But he suggests these overpayments ultimately occurred because individual carers failed to report fluctuations in their earnings that breached benefit rules. “Incidentally what has been missed in all the [media] coverage is that this error (and hands up we made it and we will put it right) affects only a relatively small number of cases and wasn’t the cause of the original complaint. Because at the heart of the overpayment issues in CA [carer’s allowance] is a failure to report changes of circumstances,” Couling wrote. This is at odds with the government’s own position, which accepts the DWP itself was the main cause of overpayments because of its confusing guidance and unclear reporting processes. Kirsty McHugh, the chief executive of Carers Trust, said: “This seems to be a really serious error of judgment. There has been an independent review which came up with some very clear findings. The DWP must now stand by this report and get on with returning money to carers.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said: “I’m disgusted by this blogpost as it shows some senior DWP people have learned nothing about the scale of the misery their policies and procedures inflicted. It’s high time the DWP showed some respect to carers and some awareness of their own gross errors.” Emily Holzhausen, the director of policy at Carers UK, said: “To say that the heart of the matter is claimants’ fault for not reporting changes in circumstances is missing the point entirely. The root cause of this is a confusing, complex and difficult-to-navigate system, which has caused numerous errors.” The government-commissioned Sayce review was ordered after an award-winning Guardian investigation revealed how unpaid carers had been unfairly hit with draconian penalties of as much as £20,000 after unwittingly running up overpayments of carer’s allowance benefit. The government announced in response to the review last month that it would reassess some overpayments issued to carers during the past 10 years. It estimates about 200,000 cases will be reviewed, with 26,000 likely to have debts cancelled or reduced. Last week, Sir Peter Schofield, the DWP permanent secretary, apologised to MPs for what ministers have called a “mess” inherited from the previous government. “I am sorry for all of those who are affected by this, but I am going to sort it out,” Schofield said. Six years ago, Schofield refused three times to apologise to MPs over carer’s allowance failures. Although he then promised to fix the overpayment problem, 180,000 carers ran up debts of £300m on his watch between 2019 and 2025, roughly one in five of all claimants, of whom 854 were convicted of fraud. Speaking on Sunday morning, Pat McFadden, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said: “What he [Couling] said is not the position of the department. This was a longstanding problem which had been ignored by the last government, like many other things that we’re having to deal with. “We commissioned Liz Sayce to do a report on this. She came forward with recommendations and – let me be clear, on behalf of the department – we support her report. We’re going to fix this. We’re going to fix the issues that were wrong with payments to carers. That’s the position of the department.” A DWP spokesperson said: “We have been clear, and remain of the view, that we accept the vast majority of recommendations put forward in the Sayce review, including that confusing rules on averaging earnings left carers facing unexpected debts. “That’s why we are tackling this issue and ",Patrick Butler Social policy editor,Society,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.220847Z,news

The civil lawsuit, which initially began in November, alleges that Blaine McGraw, a doctor and army major at Fort Hood in Texas, repeatedly inappropriately touched and secretly filmed dozens of women during appointments at an on-base medical center. The women allege they were “subjected to invasive, unnecessary, and degrading touching, voyeurism, and covert filming”. Attorneys for the alleged victims submitted an expanded complaint on Wednesday, less than a day after the army’s office of special trial counsel filed criminal charges against McGraw. According to CNN, the criminal charges involve 54 specifications of “indecent visual recording” and other related offenses concerning 44 identified victims. While the military’s case centers on the alleged recordings, the updated civil suit goes further, accusing McGraw of assault, sexual assault and battery under Texas law. The filing claims he “intentionally and knowingly made harmful and offensive physical contact” during gynecological exams. McGraw treated patients at Fort Hood beginning in 2023. One active-duty soldier described an encounter during a rape-kit examination in which she suspects McGraw took photos of her. “During that deeply vulnerable procedure, he was constantly on his phone while between her legs,” the lawsuit states. The woman now believes he used his phone to photograph her during the exam. The complaint also says that McGraw “failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed”. Prosecutors who subsequently pressed her case in criminal court “lacked clear forensic documentation, and her assailant was ultimately acquitted”, the complaint contends. “McGraw’s misconduct in this setting did not merely fail to protect a victim of sexual violence,” the filing adds. “It actively undermined her access to justice and allowed her perpetrator to escape accountability.” Legal experts and advocacy groups told the Washington Post the case may test whether recent Pentagon reforms to address sexual misconduct and support survivors are working as intended.",Marina Dunbar,US news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.220958Z,news
0dcf65af3f070c94cf3a4776edba7ba3,Florida declares US Muslim civil rights group a foreign terrorist organization,2025-12-09T15:16:02Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/florida-cair-foreign-terrorist-organization-desantis,"Florida is declaring the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) – a US civil rights and liberties group – a foreign terrorist organization, the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, announced on Monday. The move closely follows a similar order issued in November by Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, DeSantis’s fellow Republican, even though only the federal government can designate terrorist organizations. Cair and its supporters are among those who have dismissed the orders from DeSantis and Abbott as Islamophobia. In a statement, the national and Florida Cair chapters described DeSantis’s order as a “stunt” and accused him of signing a “defamatory and unconstitutional order baselessly smearing” them. The groups vowed to sue Florida as it has Texas, where Abbott has directed law enforcement officials to investigate whether a group in Dallas is operating courts under sharia law. “Governor DeSantis knows full well that Cair-Florida is an American civil rights organization that has spent decades advancing free speech, religious freedom and justice for all,” including for the people of Palestine, the groups said in a statement. DeSantis said the executive order naming Cair, one of the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy groups, was “effective immediately”. His order also targets the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist group founded in 1928. Neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor Cair are on the US government’s list of designated FTO groups. Nonetheless, “Florida agencies are hereby directed to undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organizations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support,” DeSantis said in a statement on X. The order said Cair was “founded by persons connected to the Muslim Brotherhood,” which it connects to Hamas and the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Cair denies ties to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. Cair’s Florida and national chapters said DeSantis through his order had prioritized “serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida” – and of diverting “millions in Florida taxpayer dollars to the Israeli government’s bonds”. DeSantis and Abbott, it added, want “to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims”, who criticize the US’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza. In a separate statement on X, DeSantis said that members of the Florida legislature “are crafting legislation to stop the creep of sharia law, and I hope that they codify these protections for Floridians against Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood in their legislation”. Abbott’s order in Texas prohibited Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood from acquiring property in the state and authorizing legal action to shut down affiliated entities. Cair sent a letter to Abbott in November saying it “has spent 30 years vocally speaking up against all forms of bigotry, including anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism, as well as all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism”.",Edward Helmore,US news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.221013Z,news
e7c52b25cd1ffe95adc2a912fdf6de08,Sudan’s brutal civil war – what has happened in El Fasher?,2025-10-31T10:14:32Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/31/sudan-civil-war-el-fasher-explained,"Another devastating chapter in Sudan’s brutal civil war has taken place as the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces captured El Fasher from the army after an 18-month siege that trapped tens of thousands of civilians in the city in Darfur. The RSF now controls all major urban centres in Darfur, a development that raises the possibility the country could face partition. What has happened in El Fasher this week? In a statement on Sunday, the RSF said it had “extended control over the city of El Fasher from the grip of mercenaries and militias”. The day after, the Sudanese army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, confirmed that his forces had withdrawn from the city “to a safer location”, effectively conceding its loss. Since then the RSF has been accused of killing hundreds of unarmed civilians in ethnically motivated attacks. The group has also been accused of hunting down specific individuals, detaining civilians, and releasing them only after receiving ransom payments – a pattern consistent with what happened after the RSF took over other major cities. Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab has said the level of violence is comparable to the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide. How do we know about what is going on? International journalists are not on the ground in Darfur, and news agencies have been unable to reach residents in El Fasher, where the Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate reports that communications have been cut off under a media blackout. Much of what is known about the atrocities has instead come to light from video footage – much of it filmed by the RSF themselves – geolocated by journalists and human rights analysts; testimony from survivors who escaped to the nearby town of Tawila; and, crucially, satellite image analysis conducted by the Yale lab. Videos have emerged showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters”, according to the UN. Separately, footage shared by pro-democracy activists appeared to show bodies scattered on the ground alongside burnt-out vehicles. In a report released on Tuesday, the Yale lab said El Fasher “appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa and Berti indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”. Analysts also identified what appeared to be “door-to-door clearance operations” across the city, where militants went house to house committing a series of acts of violence. The Yale team said satellite images also showed large “clusters” consistent with adult human bodies and red discoloration on the ground. Who are the RSF and what are the origins of Sudan’s civil war? The RSF was officially formed in 2013 from the remnants of the Janjaweed militia, deputed by Sudan’s former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir to suppress a tribal rebellion in the Darfur region. That operation ended with the genocide of up to 300,000 people. A civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese army began in April 2023 after a power struggle between the two forces, and the conflict quickly spread across the country. Both sides have been accused of a litany of human rights violations and war crimes against civilians. The US, UN and others have also determined that the RSF has committed genocide and mass rape against ethnic Masalit and non-Arab communities in Darfur. In August that year, famine was declared in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, south of El Fasher. In April, the RSF killed as many as 2,000 people when it seized the camp, which at the time housed 500,000 people. What role is the international community playing? The world appeared to be placing some focus on Sudan earlier this year when a conference held in London brought together 17 countries, as well as the EU and African Union, to discuss the conflict. It was accompanied by some new pledges of aid, and was billed as an effort to build a new consensus on a way forward. But there was widespread criticism that some of the countries at the conference were allegedly involved with the conflict, most notably the United Arab Emirates. Sudan’s military government has accused the UAE of supplying arms to the RSF, which the Emiratis have denied. In April, a leaked UN experts’ report found “multiple” flights from the UAE, as transport planes made apparently deliberate attempts to avoid detection as they flew into bases in Chad, where arms smuggling across the border into Darfur has been monitored. The UAE’s relationship with the RSF can be traced back to the 2015 Yemen war, where the RSF was used to recruit fighters who were sent to Yemen to fight for the Saudi and UAE forces. The UAE’s interest in Sudan is also down to its gold, most which has ended up in the UAE in recent years.",Aamna Mohdin and Kaamil Ahmed,World news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.221073Z,news

A total of 73 academics, senior lawyers, data protection experts and organisations including Statewatch and the Good Law Project, have written a letter to Chi Onwurah, the chair of the cross-party Commons science, innovation and technology committee, coordinated by Open Rights Group, calling for an inquiry to be held into the office of the information commissioner, John Edwards. “We are concerned about the collapse in enforcement activity by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which culminated in the decision to not formally investigate the Ministry of Defence (MoD) following the Afghan data breach,” the signatories state. They warn of “deeper structural failures” beyond that data breach. The Afghan data breach was a particularly serious leak of information relating to individual Afghans who worked with British forces before the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021. Those who discovered their names had been disclosed say it has put their lives at risk. “Data breaches expose individuals to serious danger and are liable of disrupting government and business continuity,” the letter states. “However, in a recent public hearing hosted by your committee, Commissioner John Edwards has shown unwillingness to reconsider his approach to data protection enforcement, even in face of the most serious data breach that has ever occurred in the UK.” The signatories cite other serious data breaches including those affecting victims of the Windrush scandal. But they say the ICO has applied its “public sector approach” in these cases and either issued reprimands – written notices that lack the force of law – or significantly lowered the monetary penalties it awarded. “The ICO decision not to pursue any formal action against the MoD despite their repeated failures was extraordinary, as was its failure to record its decision making. The picture that emerges is one where the ICO public sector approach lacks deterrence, and fails to drive the adoption of good data management across government and public bodies.” “The handling of the Afghan data breach is not an isolated case; many are being let down by the ICO and its numerous failures to use corrective powers.” The letter warns that alongside the shift away from enforcement in the public sector, statistics contained in the latest ICO report show that private sector enforcement is also becoming rarer as organisations are diverting resources away from compliance and responsible data practices, knowing that the ICO is not going to pursue the matter. “Parliament has given the ICO considerable powers not to politely hope for the best, but to enforce compliance with legally binding orders. As we heard from the public hearing you hosted, the ICO chose not to use these powers to address the Afghan data breach. “Unfortunately, the Afghan data breach is not an isolated incident, but the symptom of deeper structural failures which are emerging in the way the ICO operates.” The letter concludes: “Change appears to be unlikely unless the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee uses their oversight powers and steps in.” A spokesperson for the ICO said: “We have a range of regulatory powers and tools to choose from when responding to systemic issues in a given sector or industry. “We respect the important role civil society plays in scrutinising our choices and will value the opportunity to discuss our approach during our next regular engagement. We also welcome our opportunities to account for our work when speaking to and appearing before the DSIT select committee.”",Diane Taylor,Technology,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.221131Z,news

b9e33da64593df3115ebc7b9c55e7402,Civil rescue groups in Mediterranean cut ties with Libyan coastguard,2025-11-07T15:58:35Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/07/civil-rescue-groups-in-mediterranean-cut-ties-with-libyan-coastguard,"More than a dozen NGO rescue vessels operating in the Mediterranean have suspended communication with the Libyan coastguard, citing escalating incidents of asylum seekers being violently intercepted at sea and taken to camps rife with torture, rape and forced labour. The 13 search-and-rescue organisations described their decision as a rejection of mounting pressure by the EU, and Italy in particular, to share information with the Libyan coastguard, which receives training, equipment and funding from the EU. In an effort to reduce the number of people arriving in Europe, the EU has long faced accusations of ignoring widespread abuse and systematic human rights violations against people in Libya. In 2021, a UN investigation found that migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees in Libya were subjected to a “litany of abuses” in detention centres and at the hands of traffickers, with one member of the mission noting that the findings were “suggestive of crimes against humanity”. This week, the search-and-rescue organisations described the Libyan coastguard as an “illegitimate actor at sea”, noting that Libya was not a place of safety for refugees. “We have never recognised these actors as a legitimate rescue authority – they are part of a violent regime enabled by the EU,” said Ina Friebe, of the German activist group CompassCollective, in a joint statement put out by the 13 organisations. “Now we are increasingly being pressured to communicate with exactly these actors. This must stop,” she said. “Ending all operational communication with the so-called Libyan Rescue Coordination Center is both a legal and moral necessity – a clear line against European complicity in crimes against humanity.” The organisations acknowledged that the decision could result in them facing fines, detentions and the confiscation of their rescue vessels. Giulia Messmer, of Berlin-based Sea-Watch, said: “It is not only our right but our duty to treat armed militias as such in our operational communication – not as legitimate actors in search-and-rescue operations.” In the past 10 years, rescue organisations operating in the Mediterranean have saved more than 155,000 people from drowning. In doing so, they have come under increased pressure; campaigners have criticised an escalating crackdown on them by Italy, where hardline rules have blocked vessels from leaving port for a collective total of more than 700 days, while in August, Libya’s coastguard was accused of firing on a vessel belonging to SOS Méditerranée. A report published last month by Sea-Watch accused the Libyan coastguard of 54 violent incidents since 2016, including shootings, ramming vessels, and threatening and assaulting people in distress. The search-and-rescue organisations said this week that they had launched a new alliance, the Justice Fleet, whose website would track incidents involving the Libyan coastguard and compile information on legal cases pursued by the NGOs. The NGOs behind the alliance – the largest group of civil search-and-rescue organisations to date – described it as a means of pushing back against the escalating pressure they faced. “For 10 years, civil sea rescue has been providing first aid in the Mediterranean. For that, we have been blocked, criminalised, slandered,” the Justice Fleet website said. “That’s why we are joining forces now, stronger than ever – to defend human rights and international maritime law together.”",Ashifa Kassam European community affairs correspondent,World news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.221244Z,news

An estimated 32,000 volunteers from around the world joined the anti-fascist brigades during the civil war, including approximately 2,500 men and women from Britain and Ireland, of whom 530 were killed. At a ceremony in Madrid, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said of the new citizens: “It will be an honour to call them compatriots. We call for the defence of the same democracy as they did at a time when it is under threat around the world.” This month is the 50th anniversary of the death of Francisco Franco, whose coup in July 1936 triggered the three-year conflict. Jim Jump, the chair of the International Brigade Memorial Trust in London, said: “The Spanish government’s decision underlines its determination to erase the toxic legacy of the Franco dictatorship. Many families of International Brigaders continued to campaign for the restoration of democracy in Spain during those dark years. “Spanish citizenship for them fulfils the spirit of the historic pledge made by the Spanish Republic to offer a home for the Brigaders.” One of those to receive citizenship is Peter Crome, a retired professor of geriatric medicine and son of Len Crome, who served as a doctor in the International Brigades at Jarama, near Madrid, and during the Battle of the Ebro. Crome was born in Latvia, then part of the Russian empire, and came to Britain in 1926 where he studied medicine in Edinburgh. “He was what today you’d call a lefty but he wasn’t a member of a political party,” Peter Crome said. “He was concerned about the rise of fascism and antisemitism. In common with many others, those were the factors that led him to Spain.” Len Crome was a polyglot who spoke Russian and German among other languages and so was able to communicate with many of the volunteers who came from all over the world. As a result, by the time the brigades were withdrawn late in 1938, he had been promoted to chief medical officer. On his return to Britain, he anticipated the war with Germany and applied to join the territorial army. However, he was rejected on the grounds that he didn’t have a British father and as such “was now eligible for removal from the UK”. Peter believes that rejection and his experiences in Spain were what led his father to join the Communist party. His suspect parentage did not stop him from being conscripted later in the war where he once again served as a doctor and was awarded the military cross for bravery in Italy at the Battle of Monte Cassino. Peter Crome said this recognition of the volunteers’ descendants is the fruit of a long campaign by groups in Spain and elsewhere. Between 2009 and 2013, citizenship was granted to 23 of the then surviving members of the International Brigades. The government has also taken further steps to outlaw the National Francisco Franco Foundation, giving it 10 days to refute the accusation that its goals and activities run counter to the spirit of the democratic memory law because they promote “an apologia for Francoism” and “demean the victims’ dignity”. Once the deadline has passed, judicial proceedings will begin. The government is expected to pass a royal decree later this month calling for the removal of pro-fascist symbols and other relics of the dictatorship “so that they can be removed once and for all from our streets, squares, villages and cities, without excuses or delays”, Sánchez said. In addition to honouring the international volunteers, the government also recognised its “debt of gratitude” to 18 victims of the dictatorship, among them the poet Federico García Lorca, who was murdered in 1936, and the film-maker Luis Buñuel, who was exiled and had his work censored in Spain. Laura García Lorca, the poet’s niece, said: “On receiving this recognition today, we think not only of Federico but also the tens of thousands of women and men who lost their lives, their freedom or their freedom of expression, who were shot by firing squads, imprisoned, exiled, purged or condemned to silence.” Among the lesser-known figures honoured during the ceremony were Margot Moles Piña, a pioneer of women’s sport in Spain, and the trade unionist Antonio Menchén Bartolomé. María Luisa Ramos Barril, 98, who was deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp in 1940, was present to receive the award.",Stephen Burgen in Barcelona,World news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.221303Z,news

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which are reportedly backed by the United Arab Emirates, seized El Fasher in Darfur last week after a near 18-month siege. Some of its troops have posted videos of civilians being shot, including in the town’s maternity hospital. The two-year civil war between the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the RSF has created what the UN has described as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century. More than 150,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million displaced from their homes. Prosecutors at the international criminal court said on Monday that they were collecting evidence of alleged mass killings, rape and other crimes in El Fasher. Guterres urged the warring parties to “come to the negotiating table, bring an end to this nightmare of violence – now”. “The horrifying crisis in Sudan … is spiralling out of control,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Summit for Social Development in Qatar. “El Fasher and the surrounding areas in North Darfur have been an epicentre of suffering, hunger, violence and displacement. And since the Rapid Support Forces entered El Fasher last weekend, the situation is growing worse by the day. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped by this siege. People are dying of malnutrition, disease and violence.” His call at the Doha conference came as the SAF, based in Port Sudan, discussed whether to support a US-proposed truce, or to insist any ceasefire be dependent on the RSF withdrawing from Sudan’s cities, including El Fasher. The fall of El Fasher gives the RSF control of all five state capitals in Darfur, raising fears that Sudan could in effect be partitioned along an east-west axis, but the Sudanese ambassador to the UK, Babikir Elamin, said there was little support for partition in Darfur itself. He said the priority was not a ceasefire, but action to end the massacres in El Fasher. The US has been trying since September to persuade the two sides to back a peace plan agreed by Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia that would start with a three-month humanitarian pause, followed by a permanent ceasefire that would start a nine-month transition to a civilian-led government. Washington is hoping that with the two-year civil war finally attracting greater world attention, the publicity may force the warring parties and their external supporters to relent on their maximalist positions. Initial signs from a lengthy SAF security and defence council meeting, however, are that there is strong resistance to the US plan developed by Donald Trump’s envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos. Some SAF sources, admitting they were under new pressure from Egypt to accept a ceasefire, countered with a call for the RSF to be confined to camps outside cities. It is not clear how such RSF withdrawals could be enforced. Speaking in London, Elamin called on Washington to designate the RSF a terrorist organisation and for a ban on all arms sales to the UAE. The UAE denies supplying weapons to the RSF. Elamin said: “The RSF are now openly and publicly vowing to commit yet further crimes in cities and parts of the country. They have named the cities, the communities and the ethnic groups they are targeting. “Parts of the country that have never witnessed violence are now threatened. They are proudly making videos of themselves murdering innocent civilians. Some of them admit they have lost count of the number of people they have killed.” He said that as the SAF leadership had been exploring the US peace plan, the RSF were attacking El Fasher. “What is the reason for getting engaged in talks while they are still committing these kind of atrocities,” he asked. “Before we can discuss the kind of proposal, the international community should show some kind of seriousness in dealing with these atrocities that are still taking place in El Fasher. The priority now must be to stop the atrocities and this kind of genocide.”",Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor,World news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:50.221354Z,news

Building the massive information warehouses takes an average of two years in the US and requires copious amounts of energy to fuel the facilities. The company, maker of the AI chatbot Claude, popular with businesses adopting AI, said in a statement that the “scale of this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for Claude from hundreds of thousands of businesses while keeping our research at the frontier”. Anthropic said its projects will create about 800 permanent jobs and 2,400 construction jobs. The startup said it is working with London-based Fluidstack to build the new computing facilities to power its AI systems. It didn’t disclose their exact locations or what source of electricity the facilities will need. The latest deals show that the tech industry is moving forward on huge spending to build energy-hungry AI infrastructure, despite lingering financial concerns about a bubble, environmental considerations and the political effects of fast-rising electricity bills in the communities where they’re constructed. Another company, cryptocurrency-mining datacenter developer TeraWulf, has previously revealed it was working with Fluidstack on Google-backed datacenter projects in Texas and New York, on the shore of Lake Ontario. Microsoft also on Wednesday announced a new datacenter under construction in Atlanta, Georgia, describing it as connected to another in Wisconsin to form a “massive supercomputer” running on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips to power AI technology. A report last month from TD Cowen said that the leading cloud computing providers leased a “staggering” amount of US datacenter capacity in the third fiscal quarter of this year, amounting to more than 7.4GW of energy, more than all of last year combined. The tech industry’s huge amount of spending on computing infrastructure for AI startups that aren’t yet profitable has fueled concerns about an AI investment bubble. Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI and Anthropic and the companies building the costly computer chips and datacenters needed to power their AI products. Anthropic said it will continue to “prioritize cost-effective, capital-efficient approaches” to scaling up its business.",Guardian staff,Technology,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181098Z,news
cbcee0017cc5f317edb3e9fad811b097,UK construction sector ‘suffers sharpest slowdown since first Covid lockdown’,2025-12-04T13:49:18Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/04/uk-construction-sector-suffers-sharpest-slowdown-since-first-covid-lockdown,"The UK construction sector last month suffered its sharpest slowdown in activity since the first Covid lockdown as building projects were scaled back and jobs cut amid budget uncertainty, according to a closely watched survey. In a blow to Labour’s aims to boost infrastructure projects and build 1.5m homes by 2030, the poll of UK construction firms showed output in November shrinking at the fastest pace since May 2020, when all building stalled as the pandemic shut down sites. The monthly purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for construction, considered one of the best indicators of growth in the sector, fell to 39.4 in November, down from 44.1 in October and below the 44.6 forecast by economists. Any reading above 50 represents growth and anything below a contraction. The only other time the PMI survey, which is compiled by the data firm S&amp;P Global, has suggested such a sharp contraction in new construction work was during the financial crisis in 2009, when the housing market crashed. Builders have been scaling back on residential projects over the past year amid a subdued housing market and rising construction costs. Infrastructure and commercial development work also contracted sharply in November, as clients deferred investment decisions due to uncertainty about the autumn budget and “pervasive worries” about the UK economic outlook. Separate Bank of England research has suggested businesses in the UK cut jobs at the fastest rate in four years in November. The survey of chief financial officers showed companies reduced employment by an annual rate of 1.8%, the sharpest contraction since July 2021. The survey, called the decision maker panel, is closely monitored by Bank officials and has been cited by members of its interest rate-setting committee. Optimism for the year ahead remained subdued, with financial officers expecting employment to fall by 0.7%, the lowest level since October 2020. However, Robert Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, suggested both surveys had been skewed by “chaotic” speculation before the autumn budget. “We find it hard to believe that conditions in the sector are genuinely as bad as during a full lockdown,” he said. Wood said the construction output figures from the Office for National Statistics had been faring better than the PMI survey so far this year, while job postings across all sectors of the economy rose in November. “There’s no doubt that construction firms are extremely disappointed in the government’s progress, but we think the PMI remains too pessimistic.” Matthew Swannell, the chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, agreed, saying the PMI had been “much more pessimistic than official estimates”. He added: “November’s extremely weak PMI should be approached with a healthy degree of scepticism.”",Tom Knowles,Business,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181186Z,news

Data from the helpline of the antislavery charity Unseen has identified the construction industry as an emerging area of risk. It was second only to the care sector in terms of calls to its helpline in 2024 from people who claimed to be exploited. The charity identified 492 potential victims relating to construction and 586 to the care sector from calls to its helpline. It said exploitation of workers in the construction industry was an emerging trend. The industry is a cornerstone of the economy and is key to the government’s plan for 1.5m homes to be built over the next five years. CCLA, the UK’s largest charity asset manager, has repeatedly raised concerns about the incidence of modern slavery in construction. It measures how companies perform at finding, fixing and preventing modern slavery and has found that the industry underperforms on compliance with the 2015 Modern Slavery Act. Working conditions are physically demanding, there is a high reliance on migrant labour and workplaces are often not visible, leaving some workers isolated. Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister, attended a meeting organised by CCLA with senior construction industry representatives and civil society organisations. In comments she made during the private discussions, which were shared with the Guardian, she said: “The construction sector is vital to our national ambition and our economy, but it is also vulnerable. The risk of exploitation is incredibly high in this sector. We are at a pivotal juncture as we push forward with major housing and infrastructure programmes, but we must ensure that progress does not come at the cost of workers’ rights. “I know it can be uncomfortable to publicly disclose these issues, but the culture needs to shift. Modern slavery is extremely prevalent. If you are not finding it, I would suggest you are not looking hard enough.” The employment rights bill, which is going through parliament, aims to strengthen protections for workers including against modern slavery and labour exploitation. The Work Rights Centre has raised concerns that protections against modern slavery and labour exploitation do not go far enough. The government updated its guidance on transparency in supply chains earlier this year. Research commissioned by the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre at the University of Oxford last month found significant gaps in knowledge of modern slavery and labour exploitation in the construction industry. “Without improved data, reporting mechanisms and enforcement capacity the true scale of exploitation is likely to remain hidden,” the report said. It called on agencies that monitor modern slavery and labour exploitation to do more to analyse and share the data they collect. Sara Thornton, the director of modern slavery at CCLA, said: “Multiple layers of subcontracting, the use of casual labour and skill shortages mean that the construction sector remains at high risk of labour exploitation in the UK. And material supply chains are long and opaque with many raw materials sourced from countries with weak labour market enforcement and poor human rights records.” Case study Frank (not his real name) was tricked into coming to the UK from Barbados with his 14-year-old son and endured more than three years of slavery in the construction industry. “The person that brought me here won my trust, so I was shocked. I didn’t understand there was such a thing as modern-day slavery,” he said. “One day I lost my job. It was a big salary hit, and it knocked me flat. He gave me a lifeline. ‘Come work for six months – you can earn up to £600 per week.’ “They took us back to this house, and then they let me know the business. If I don’t do the work, they were gonna kill my son – I had no choice. “So I was getting up at five in the morning until six at night, going out in extreme weather conditions. I’d never been in snow before, working in snow with no proper clothing or equipment. I was hungry to the point where you have conversations with your stomach. Lifting 500 to 600 blocks from one scaffolding to another scaffolding, stirring concrete, tiling roofs, building walls – boy, it was hard. “I never worked the same place twice. I used to be in the back of the van with the tools, and we drive all over. I worked places I never even knew existed. “The people whose houses we worked on, private homes and stuff, they don’t know this was going on. When they come in, you’re gone. They don’t care who’s doing the work, they just pay to get the work done. “For three-and-a-half years, I just complied and did what they wanted, but I got weaker and weaker and weaker, and I couldn’t get the work done any more. “One morning, I just snapped because I was too weak to lift the blocks, too weak to do anything.

937f63216c546484f10f12167d004a72,UK police forces lobbied to use biased facial recognition technology,2025-12-10T06:00:44Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/10/police-facial-recognition-technology-bias,"Police forces successfully lobbied to use a facial recognition system known to be biased against women, young people, and members of ethnic minority groups, after complaining that another version produced fewer potential suspects. UK forces use the police national database (PND) to conduct retrospective facial recognition searches, whereby a “probe image” of a suspect is compared to a database of more than 19 million custody photos for potential matches. The Home Office admitted last week that the technology was biased, after a review by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) found it misidentified Black and Asian people and women at significantly higher rates than white men, and said it “had acted on the findings”. Documents seen by the Guardian and Liberty Investigates reveal that the bias has been known about for more than a year – and that police forces argued to overturn an initial decision designed to address it. Police bosses were told the system was biased in September 2024, after a Home Office-commissioned review by the NPL found the system was more likely to suggest incorrect matches for probe images depicting women, Black people, and those aged 40 and under. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) ordered that the confidence threshold required for potential matches be increased to a level where the bias was significantly reduced. That decision was reversed the following month after forces complained the system was producing fewer “investigative leads”. NPCC documents show that the higher threshold reduced the number of searches resulting in potential matches from 56% to 14%. Though the Home Office and NPCC refused to say what threshold was being used now, the recent NPL study found the system could produce false positives for Black women almost 100 times more frequently than white women at certain settings. When publishing those results, the Home Office said: “The testing identified that in a limited set of circumstances the algorithm is more likely to incorrectly include some demographic groups in its search results.” Describing the impact of the brief increase to the system’s confidence threshold, the NPCC documents states of the change in threshold sought by the police forces: “The change significantly reduces the impact of bias across protected characteristics of race, age and gender but had a significant negative impact on operational effectiveness”, adding that forces complained that “a once effective tactic returned results of limited benefit”. The government has opened a ten-week consultation on its plans to widen the use of facial recognition technology. Sarah Jones, the policing minister, has described the technology as the “biggest breakthrough since DNA matching”. Prof Pete Fussey, a former independent reviewer of the Met’s use of facial recognition, said he was concerned by the apparent priorities of police forces. He said: “This raises the question of whether facial recognition only becomes useful if users accept biases in ethnicity and gender. Convenience is a weak argument for overriding fundamental rights, and one unlikely to withstand legal scrutiny.” Abimbola Johnson, chair of the independent scrutiny and oversight board for the police race action plan, said: “There was very little discussion through race action plan meetings of the facial recognition rollout despite obvious cross-over with the plan’s concerns. “These revelations show once again that the anti-racism commitments policing has made through the race action plan are not being translated into wider practice. Our reports have warned that new technologies are being rolled out in a landscape where racial disparities, weak scrutiny and poor data collection already persist. “Any use of facial recognition must meet strict national standards, be independently scrutinised, and demonstrate it reduces rather than compounds racial disparity.” Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman, NPCC lead for PND, said that safeguards had been put in place to mitigate the bias. She said: “The decision to revert to the original algorithm threshold was not taken lightly and was made to best protect the public from those who could cause harm, illustrating the balance that must be struck in policing’s use of facial recognition. “Following the identification of bias, we reissued and promoted training and guidance to Police National Database (PND) users to ensure all existing safeguards were used to reduce the risk of incorrect image returns informing operational decisions. “We are confident these safeguards protect the public from the identified bias and enable us to use retrospective facial recognition responsibly and transparently to combat crime and protect the public.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office takes the findings of the report seriously and we have already taken action. A new algorithm has been independently tested and procured, which has no statistically significant bias. It will be tested early next year and will be subj",Mark Wilding and Daniel Boffey,Technology,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181315Z,news

The oil company, which paused construction at the site in July last year to tackle technical problems, said it had decided not to restart building after it found the plant would be “insufficiently competitive” to meet demand for “affordable, low-carbon products”. The move to scrap the project in Rotterdam marks another setback for its biofuel designs, after the company cancelled a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project on Singapore’s Bukom Island in March 2023. It comes amid a wider shift away from renewable energy projects in the oil and gas sector as fossil fuel companies pursue higher profits. In March last year Shell watered down a key emissions target, setting out a plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade compared with its previous goal of 20%. Shell began construction of the plant in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2021, initially expecting to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels, with plans to bring it online in April 2024. This was later pushed back to 2025. Machteld de Haan, the company’s head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products. “This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.” She added that the company continued “to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system” and that Shell was “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”. About half of the biofuels from the plant in Rotterdam were expected to be used for SAF, made from waste cooking oil and animal fat. Proponents of SAF believe it could be crucial for airlines to cut their carbon emissions in line with global climate targets, although critics argue it is not a realistic alternative given the limited timescale to prevent rising emissions from creating a climate disaster. The aviation industry accounts for about 3% of the world’s carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.",Lauren Almeida,Business,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181369Z,news

The comments came in OpenAI’s response to a lawsuit filed against the San Francisco company and its chief executive, Sam Altman, by the family of California teenager Adam Raine. Raine killed himself in April after extensive conversations and “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, the family’s lawyer has said. The lawsuit alleges the teenager discussed a method of suicide with ChatGPT on several occasions, that it guided him on whether a suggested method would work, offered to help him write a suicide note to his parents and that the version of the technology he used was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”. According to filings at the superior court of the state of California on Tuesday, OpenAI said that “to the extent that any ‘cause’ can be attributed to this tragic event” Raine’s “injuries and harm were caused or contributed to, directly and proximately, in whole or in part, by [his] misuse, unauthorised use, unintended use, unforeseeable use, and/or improper use of ChatGPT”. It said that its terms of use prohibited asking ChatGPT for advice about self-harm and highlighted a limitation of liability provision that states “you will not rely on output as a sole source of truth or factual information”. OpenAI, which is valued at $500bn (£380bn), said its goal was to “handle mental health-related court cases with care, transparency, and respect” and that “independent of any litigation, we’ll remain focused on improving our technology in line with our mission”. The blogpost added: “Our deepest sympathies are with the Raine family for their unimaginable loss. Our response to these allegations includes difficult facts about Adam’s mental health and life circumstances. “The original complaint included selective portions of his chats that require more context, which we have provided in our response. We have limited the amount of sensitive evidence that we’ve publicly cited in this filing, and submitted the chat transcripts themselves to the court under seal.” The family’s lawyer, Jay Edelson, called OpenAI’s response “disturbing” and said the company “tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, by arguing that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act”. Earlier this month, OpenAI was hit by seven further lawsuits in California courts relating to ChatGPT, including an allegation it acted as a “suicide coach”. A spokesperson for the company said at the time: “This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we’re reviewing the filings to understand the details. We train ChatGPT to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.” In August, Open AI said it was strengthening the safeguards in ChatGPT when people engage in long conversations because experience had shown that parts of the model’s safety training might degrade in these situations. “For example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards,” it said. “This is exactly the kind of breakdown we are working to prevent.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

This is the lowest commercial construction since 2014 and comes as housebuilding is also slowing, in a blow to the Labour government, which last year announced an ambitious target of building 1.5m new homes over five years. This year is on course to be the weakest for construction starts so far this century, amid high construction costs caused by skill shortages and rising raw material prices, and high vacancy rates, according to the report from the property information company. Construction has also been hit by rising interest rates since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and falling values of commercial buildings. Despite a series of cuts from the Bank of England over the past year, interest rates remain higher than in the post-financial crisis years when borrowing costs were very low and returns on property higher. Investment in offices fell in the third quarter amid uncertainty around pricing, volatile geopolitics and the economy, and as high bond yields reduced the appeal of the market, CoStar said. However, there are a number of big transactions under offer in London, suggesting a rebound in the fourth quarter. In better news for the property sector, office take-up in the UK has increased to its joint highest level since the pandemic began in 2020. It rose by 24% year on year in the third quarter to about 1m sq metres (11m sq ft), as many companies ordered their staff back to in-person working. This was led by London, while outside the capital demand for commercial workspaces continues to drop. Office take-up in the capital jumped by 34% year on year to the highest level in seven years, supported by some big lettings over the summer. New York has seen a similarly strong uptick. This mirrors trends in the US, where return-to-office mandates drove lettings up by 22% to their highest level since the second quarter of 2019. The vacancy rate at UK offices has stabilised at 8.8%, but is still the highest in 13 years, and nearly double the 4.5% when the pandemic struck. In London, the vacancy rate dipped to 10.7% from 10.9% at the end of 2024, but remains above the national average. In the warehouse sector, the vacancy rate has more than doubled to 5.5%, from 2.5% in mid-2022. The online shopping boom during the pandemic boosted demand for warehouses but it has cooled since. A further 557,000 sq metres of warehouse completions outpaced stagnant demand in the third quarter.",Julia Kollewe,Business,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181533Z,news

Satellite images on Friday showed the historic building’s eastern section reduced to rubble, to the outrage of historians, former White House officials and much of the public. Also on Friday, senior administration officials told ABC News that Trump “will likely name” the ballroom after himself. Officials told the outlet that that some are already referring to it as “The President Donald J Trump Ballroom”. The demolition marked a reversal of Trump’s earlier promise in July that none of the White House’s existing infrastructure would be torn down during construction of the ballroom. Trump went ahead despite not first sending plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government buildings across the region. On Thursday, a White House official told Reuters that construction plans “will be soon” submitted. A White House official also told the Guardian that “The National [Capital] Planning Commission does not require permits for demolition, only for vertical construction. Permits will be submitted to the NPC at the appropriate time.” Earlier this week, however, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit established by Congress, sent a letter to the White House stating that the demolition plans are “legally required” to undergo public review. Meanwhile, a Virginia couple filed a motion in Washington federal court on Thursday, requesting a temporary restraining order on the project. In their motion, Charles and Judith Voorhees said that the construction was taking place “without legally required approvals or reviews”. “Defendants are unilaterally decoupling the demolition of the East Wing of the White House from the construction approval process to expedite the project, effectively bypassing the historic preservation and planning reviews required under federal law for a project of this magnitude on a protected national landmark,” the motion added. Donors of the proposed ballroom include a slew of major tech companies. Among those are Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google. Defense contractors and communications companies have also pitched in, including Lockheed Martin, Palantir, T-Mobile and Comcast. Touting the proposal of the 90,000 sq ft ballroom, Trump said the construction “is being paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”.",Maya Yang,US news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181586Z,news

The Home Office has admitted that the technology was “more likely to incorrectly include some demographic groups in its search results”, after testing by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) of its application within the police national database. The report revealed that the technology, which is intended to be used to catch serious offenders, is more likely to incorrectly match black and Asian people than their white counterparts. In a statement responding to the report, Emily Keaney, the deputy commissioner for the Information Commissioner’s Office, said the ICO had asked the Home Office “for urgent clarity on this matter” in order for the watchdog to “assess the situation and consider our next steps”. The next steps could include enforcement action, including issuing a legally binding order to stop using the technology or fines, as well as working with the Home Office and police to make improvements. Keaney said: “Last week we were made aware of historical bias in the algorithm used by forces across the UK for retrospective facial recognition within the police national database. “We acknowledge that measures are being taken to address this bias. However, it’s disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services. “While we appreciate the valuable role technology can play, public confidence in its use is paramount, and any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust. The ICO is here to support and assist the public sector to get this right.” Police and crime commissioners said publication of the NPL’s finding “sheds light on a concerning inbuilt bias” and urged caution over plans for a national expansion, which could include cameras being placed at shopping centres, stadiums and transport hubs, without putting in place adequate safeguards. The findings were released on Thursday, hours after Sarah Jones, the policing minister, had described the technology as the “biggest breakthrough since DNA matching”. Facial recognition technology scans people’s faces and cross-references the images against watchlists of known or wanted criminals. It can be used while examining live footage of people passing cameras, comparing their faces with those on wanted lists, or to enable officers to target individuals as they walk by mounted cameras. Police officers can also retrospectively run images of suspects through police, passport or immigration databases to identify them and check their backgrounds. Analysts who examined the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition technology tool at a lower setting found that “the false positive identification rate (FPIR) for white subjects (0.04%) is lower than that for Asian subjects (4.0%) and black subjects (5.5%)”. The testing found that the number of false positives for black women was particularly high. “The FPIR for black male subjects (0.4%) is lower than that for black female subjects (9.9%),” the report said. Responding to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said the department took the findings “seriously”, and had already taken action, including procuring and testing a new algorithm “which has no statistically significant bias”. “Given the importance of this issue, we have also asked the police inspectorate, alongside the forensic science regulator, to review law enforcement’s use of facial recognition. They will assess the effectiveness of the mitigations, which the National Police Chiefs’ Council supports,” the spokesperson said.",Rachel Hall,Technology,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181636Z,news

In a blow to Labour’s aims to boost infrastructure projects and build 1.5m homes by 2030, the poll of UK construction firms showed output in November shrinking at the fastest pace since May 2020, when all building stalled as the pandemic shut down sites. The monthly purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for construction, considered one of the best indicators of growth in the sector, fell to 39.4 in November, down from 44.1 in October and below the 44.6 forecast by economists. Any reading above 50 represents growth and anything below a contraction. Budget uncertainty has also been blamed for UK investors cutting their investments in equity funds in November… …and for a slowdown in sales growth of electric cars. Shares in Trustpilot fell by over a quarter today after Grizzly Research disclosed a short position and accused the global review platform of creating fake profiles that gave negative reviews and then pressuring companies to pay for subscriptions. Trustpilot has denied the claims. Households face higher energy bills after network companies were given the green light to spend £28bn on Great Britain’s gas and electricity grids. The energy watchdog, Ofgem, approved more than £17.8bn of spending plans to upgrade gas transmission and distribution networks in the five years from April 2026. A further £10.3bn will be used to rewire the nation’s high-voltage electricity network – the biggest expansion of the grid since the 1960s. Trustpilot’s attempt to rebut (see here) Grizzly Research’s accusations (see here) haven’t revived its share price. Trustpilot’s stock is now down almost 28% today, the biggest faller among the 350 largest companies listed in London. Back in the UK, new data confirms that people pulled cash out of investment funds in October, in the run-up to November’s budget. In October, equity funds saw £5bn of outflows, with all major regions in withdrawal. Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has the details: “UK retail investors pulled a net £4.5 billion from funds in October, according to the latest Investment Association data. This marks the weakest month since October 2024 and reflects a clear rise in caution as speculation around the Autumn Budget intensified. Equity funds saw the largest impact, with £5.0 billion withdrawn across all major regions. Global equities suffered the heaviest redemptions at £2.5 billion, while UK equity outflows accelerated to £1.4 billion. Sentiment also turned in North America, where concerns over stretched valuations in US mega-cap technology stocks and fears of an ‘AI bubble’ contributed to £649 million in withdrawals. Technology-focused funds recorded their biggest-ever monthly outflow of £322 million. Flows into bond funds were broadly flat at -£2 million. Investors favoured Strategic Bond, Corporate Bond and Global Emerging Markets Local Currency funds, but this was outweighed by selling in developed-market government bonds. UK Gilt and Government Bond sectors saw a combined £548 million in outflows partly due to uncertainty about the trajectory of Bank of England rate cuts. Mixed asset funds experienced their first outflows in a year, with £51 million withdrawn. Money market funds, which have been in demand throughout much of 2025, were broadly stable with marginal inflows of £1 million. Tracker funds also saw muted appetite, recording modest inflows of £306 million. Mark Zuckerberg is expected to “meaningfully cut resources” for building the metaverse, Bloomberg are reporting. They say Meta executives have discussed potential budget cuts as high as 30% for the metaverse group next year, which includes the virtual worlds product Meta Horizon Worlds and its Quest virtual reality unit. Cuts that high could most likely include layoffs as early as January, and would be a policy u-turn for Zuckerberg, who had once seen virtual reality as the future of Meta. Back in 2021, Zuckerberg renamed Facebook’s holding company to Meta, declaring “We believe the metaverse will be the successor of the mobile internet.” Since then, though, artificial intelligence has emerged as The Big Thing in technology… Just in: The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support has hit a three year low.

a38fa4a5ffa1ef58d14e1b8e8f90baa4,Drone-blocking technology ‘urgently’ required at jails in England and Wales,2025-10-31T06:00:17Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/31/drone-blocking-technology-jails-england-wales,"Drone-jamming technology must be rolled out urgently across jails in England and Wales to help stem the endemic use and trade of drugs by organised gangs, MPs have concluded. The Commons justice select committee has found that the Prison Service’s ability to maintain safety and control is being “critically undermined by the scale of the trade and use of illicit drugs”. It has called for technology such as SkyFence, which uses sensors to block a drone’s computer, to be introduced across the prison estate. Category A prisons, which hold some of the most dangerous inmates, should be given anti-drone technology within two years, according to a report released on Friday. The Labour chair of the cross-party committee, Andy Slaughter, said: “Fuelled by inflated profits, the supply of drugs by organised criminal gangs into prisons is a constant pressure. This is compounded by failure to address and reduce the underlying demand for drugs and combat the alarming rise in the use of sophisticated drone technology.” MPs found that increasing availability of illicit substances normalised drug use in prisons, noting that 39% of prisoners found it easy to acquire drugs. The situation is made worse by the high number of people entering prison with an existing addiction and the notable trend of prisoners with no previous issues developing a drug habit once in prison. Eleven per cent of men and 19% of women said they had developed a problem with drugs, alcohol or medication not prescribed to them since arriving in prison, the report says. Prison Service records indicate a 770% increase in drone sightings around prisons between 2019 and 2023. Current drug detection technologies are being outpaced by the sophistication of drones, the report says. MPs said existing partnerships with police and the National Crime Agency aimed at tackling drone incursions were not sufficient. The committee said the MoJ must urgently adopt the SkyFence system, which was deployed to detect and disrupt incoming remote-controlled drones at HMP Guernsey in 2017, or equivalent technology at all prisons. The report says: “All high-risk prisons should be put in a position to deploy comprehensive anti-drone technology and implement upgraded physical security measures, such as windows, within 24 months. “The MoJ must adopt the SkyFence system, or equivalent signal disruption technology, across the prison estate as a matter of urgency.” New government figures show that nearly 40,000 prisoners in England and Wales have been let out of jail under the government’s early release scheme to tackle overcrowding in prisons. As of the end of June this year, 38,042 inmates had been freed, according to the Ministry of Justice. The scheme was launched as an emergency measure on 10 September last year after the prison population reached a record high of 88,521. It allows eligible prisoners to be released after serving only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. It is part of efforts to curb overcrowding in jails. Officials said in May that male prisons were on track to hit zero capacity by November this year. Of the 38,042 early releases, 10,879 (28.6%) were serving sentences of six months or under, with a further 5,241 (13.8%) serving sentences of between six and 12 months. The age group that made up the greatest proportion of early releases was 30- to 39-year-olds (37.6% of the overall total), followed by 40- to 49-year-olds (23.4%). The figures show 34,332 (90.2%) were British nationals, 3,644 (9.6%) were foreign nationals and 66 (0.2%) had no nationality recorded. The current scheme for the early release of prisoners replaced a separate scheme introduced by the previous Conservative government. Under this separate process, 13,325 prisoners in England and Wales were freed early between 17 October 2023 and 9 September 2024. Prisons minister Lord Timpson said: “This sobering report lays bare the extent of the crisis we inherited in our prison system, with jails awash with drugs and facing an unprecedented threat from drones. “You cannot deliver meaningful rehabilitation when jails are flooded with drugs. That is why we’re already investing £40m this year to bolster security and stop contraband entering prisons, including counter-drone measures such as exterior netting and reinforced windows. This is alongside 85 specialist wings to help prisoners live drug-free.”",Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor,Society,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181750Z,news
7633cf561ca9d98dc00bfbcc85a4119d,Border wall slicing through Arizona wildlife corridor begins construction: ‘A show of force for nothing’ ,2025-10-01T14:00:22Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/arizona-border-wall-san-rafael-valley,"On a late summer day in September, the sound of cicadas pierced the profound silence in the sprawling grasslands and gently rolling hills of the San Rafael Valley in southern Arizona. But before long, the shrill buzzing gave way to the rumble of heavy machinery sculpting an unpaved road leading to the US-Mexico border. In the distance, a deer darted across the road and disappeared into a thicket of oak trees. A few miles later, a fenced-in worker camp came into view, next to a construction site full of trucks, bulldozers and cranes. The San Rafael Valley, south-east of Tucson, is considered one of the most biodiverse regions in North America. But in recent days, a towering black steel wall has begun to rise on the landscape. The Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to erect a 27-mile section of the border wall here, despite a legal challenge still playing out in the courts. When completed, the 30ft-high barrier will tear through one of the last pristine, unbroken grasslands in the west. Trump’s pledge to “build the wall” between the US and Mexico was a top priority during his first term, but the 1,954-mile border is still full of gaps. Construction in this remote valley is among efforts in several states to fast-track new sections along the southern border. The new wall is intended replace low barriers that stop vehicles but still allow wildlife to get across. Even before construction began, many Arizonans worried about the plan’s impact on the numerous wildlife species that regularly move between the two countries – including jaguars, ocelots, bears and mountain lions. “The wildlife there have existed for and evolved over thousands of years in a connected ecosystem and this wall will sever populations in half,” says Russ McSpadden, south-west conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. The barrier, he says, can prevent animals – including the endangered jaguar – from migrating to find food and mates, which could mean their eventual extinction. The possibility of water depletion has also concerned residents in an arid landscape that’s already grappling with drought. New wells are being drilled for drawing up groundwater to mix with concrete for the wall foundation. Previous border wall projects have required vast quantities of water, running into the hundreds of thousands of gallons per day. “It’s disheartening to see some wall panels already up,” said Erick Meza, the borderlands coordinator for the Sierra Club. “This whole place looks like an industrial area now. And we know it’s just the beginning.” The wall is taking shape even as a legal challenge proceeds in federal court over the Trump administration’s issuing of waivers that nullify more than 30 environmental and public health laws to accelerate construction. Kristi Noem, the director of the Department of Homeland Security, has characterized the wall project as necessary to prevent people from entering the country unlawfully. John Mennell, a spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which oversees wall construction, declined to comment on the lawsuit or any of the concerns raised. But local residents such as Linda Shore, director of the Red Rock Acres Homeowners Association in the former mining outpost of Patagonia near the border, aren’t convinced. Shore isn’t thrilled about the wall, or the construction traffic that could lead to accidents at what she says is a hazardous intersection near her home. But for her, the bigger issue has to do with how the wall could hurt wildlife and drain water resources at a time when unlawful border crossings are at all-time lows. Data from Customs and Border Protection show that, in Arizona, such crossings in August were down more than 90% over August 2024 along the Tucson sector that covers 262 miles of border. And this part of the San Rafael Valley has not traditionally been a frequent crossing site, according to some area residents and conservation groups that monitor animal movement along the border with cameras. “In my mind, it’s a big show of force for nothing,” says Shore. The San Rafael Valley spreads out between the Madrean Sky Islands that span both sides of the border. The biomes of the isolated mountain ranges change with elevation from desert to forest, creating a unique ecosystem where thousands of animals thrive. Human history also has left its mark on the remote valley over the span of centuries. By the late 1800s, the vast expanse had beckoned cattle ranching operations that became a significant economic driver in the area. Some cattle ranches remain in what is a mix of federal, state and private land that – thanks to conservation efforts – is largely undisturbed. Over time, small rural communities like Patagonia were built around it. Those and other communities in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, will inevitably feel the effect of a wall that is likely to alter the ecosystem balance and overall health of the land, says Zach Palma, the Mexico projects manager for",Lourdes Medrano in the San Rafael Valley,US news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.181805Z,news

The continent’s diplomats are dealing with the vexed question of whether it is wise to try to cool the planet by dimming the sun’s rays. While not on the formal summit agenda, on the sidelines they are arguing that it’s time to stop promoting solar geoengineering technology as a solution to global heating. It’s hard to disagree. African nations have acted because they don’t want their continent to become a test bed for unproven schemes to spray particles into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth for a small, uncertain cooling gain. They point to environmental, ethical and geopolitical risks. That’s why the continent is pushing for a global “non-use” agreement that would rule out public funding, outdoor experiments, patenting and official promotion of these technologies. The reason for a moratorium is obvious: solar geoengineering doesn’t cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The potential side-effects include altered rainfall patterns and the consequential pressure on food systems. Then there is the risk of a sharp temperature spike if the interventions were ever halted – the so-called termination shock. African nations’ opposition was such that they forced the withdrawal of a Swiss-backed resolution on solar radiation modification at last year’s UN talks. Yet an industry is being built on the idea that someone can take charge of the global thermostat. A US–Israeli firm is developing a spraying system for future “cooling services” to offer to governments. Other nations are pushing back. Mexico announced it would ban solar geoengineering experiments in 2023, after an unauthorised trial over its territory by a US startup. Academics have already warned that the UK became the first “major government” to significantly fund solar radiation modification (SRM) through its Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria). It is now backing scientists to research “climate cooling’” hardware and small-scale field tests. Other scientists describe the move as naive, poorly governed and scientifically incapable of proving SRM safe. Ministers ought to pull back. Research programmes have politics. Hardware and careers get built. Risky tech acquires well-funded backers. The actions of the US, the world’s largest producer of oil and gas, should be studied. The Trump administration has made “American energy dominance” the core of its economic strategy. Solar geoengineering offers a way to manage temperature risk without loosening the carbon economy’s grip. Controlling both the world’s energy supply and the global thermostat has obvious appeal to the White House – and its billionaire backers. African governments’ call for a non-use agreement for solar geoengineering – echoing the precedents of landmine and chemical weapons bans – is a recognition that some technologies shift power so sharply that they create unmanageable risks. A line has to be drawn. The precautionary principle is used with other novel technologies. Why not here? The point is clearly that this power can’t be left to a few. Africa’s call should be taken seriously. None of this weakens climate policy. It would instead focus minds on measures that address the climate emergency: cutting fossil fuel use, investing in renewables – and paying for adaptation where damage is already baked in.

However, it is not just police use of this technology that needs a clear legal framework. Despite the scale and speed of its expansion, there is still no specific law providing a basis for live facial recognition or other emerging biometric technologies, whether these are used in the public or private sector. Biometric surveillance is expanding rapidly, not just in policing but across society: in train stations, schools and supermarkets. Newer biometric systems go further, claiming to infer people’s emotional states, raising serious concerns about their accuracy, ethics and legality. In 2020, the court of appeal – in the UK’s only judgment on live facial recognition to date – found a deployment by South Wales police was unlawful. It identified deficiencies in the legal framework and set out minimum standards for lawful use. Since then, a patchwork of voluntary guidance has emerged. New research from the Ada Lovelace Institute has found this patchwork is inadequate in practice, creating legal uncertainty, putting fundamental rights at risk and undermining public trust. Crucially, we find that non-police uses, such as those in the private sector or involving inference, are subject to even fewer safeguards and so stand on far shakier legal ground. Governance is simply not keeping up with technological adoption and advancement. Policymakers must act. We urgently need new legislation to establish a comprehensive framework covering all forms of biometric surveillance and inference – not just police use – and an independent regulator to oversee and enforce it.

It has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest, as we saw in the reporting this week on the case of Shaun Thompson. It’s also known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour, so using it to target attenders of Notting Hill carnival is very concerning, especially when we consider the Casey report’s conclusion that the Metropolitan police are guilty of institutional racism. No matter who we are, we should all feel safe to move freely without risk of harassment or false arrest. These systems violate our right to privacy, our rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, and to equality and non-discrimination. This is particularly the case given the continued lack of government regulation on these technologies, leaving police to write their own rules with no accountability or oversight.

Banyule city council said in a statement that it shared the community’s concern about the pollution and was working with the EPA and Melbourne Water to understand what caused the incident and manage any consequences of it. “While we discussed the possibility of local council drains being involved, we’ve been advised that our drainage system is not considered a source of the pollution,” the council said. “Our teams will continue to work alongside EPA and Melbourne Water, inspecting downstream areas and monitoring for any ongoing effects. We’re committed to protecting our local environment and supporting the agencies managing this incident.” Clean-up duties for pollution incidents fall to the duty-holder, or the party responsible – in this case, likely a contractor to the road project – in consultation with the EPA. The NELP is part of the Victorian government’s Big Build, involving the construction of more than 6km of freeway tunnels, and estimated to cost more than $26bn. NELP was cleaning up the waterway, the EPA spokesperson said. “EPA will monitor the project which will now assess how to ensure such incidents are not repeated. EPA investigations and assessments of any harm to the environment are continuing.” A spokesperson from Major Road Projects Victoria said the department was aware of the pollution in the creek. “There is no threat to the local community,” the spokesperson said. “The site clean-up is under way – however we recommend locals keep away from the creek until reviews have concluded. We will continue to work closely with the Environment Protection Authority to ensure impacts to the local environment are minimised.”",Stephanie Convery,Environment,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.182237Z,news

But this proud Ugarapul man and Brisbane-based father maintains his independence and manages his health with the support of a multi-disciplinary care team, and digital health technology. Dillon’s life changed when he struck his head underwater after swinging from a rope into the Dawson River in Central Queensland. “I knew immediately something was wrong,” he says. “I couldn’t move my arms or legs underwater. Then I swallowed water and drowned.” Dillon was left with multiple spinal fractures and despite intensive rehabilitation, his future was shaping up to be different to the one he had envisioned. Patrick Dillon. Photo supplied. “I was always active and independent,” he says. “I played lots of footy and pretty much lived outdoors. The biggest frustration was not being able to do the things I used to be able to.” Since his accident, Dillon has embraced technology to support his independence and coordinate his care team. “My Health Record and my health app have been game changers for my care team. Having access to the same information means each of them can see when I last had prescriptions dispensed, my upcoming appointments, or any other information that helps them plan.” While Dillon’s injuries are the result of an accident, he’s all too aware of the chronic health conditions that can affect First Nations communities. Supporting equitable healthcare Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience significant disparities in the availability and accessibility of healthcare. Aboriginal Medical Services (AMS), well established in a number of locations across the country, provide culturally safe, holistic care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Now, digital tools can support AMS and empower people in these communities by making key health care information accessible. “The technology is getting better every day,” Dillon says. “I can see a real benefit in My Health Record and my health app for people in my community who are suffering chronic illness. “I’ve found that having direct access to my key health data makes me feel more informed. It makes me feel more independent and I don’t have to repeat myself and go through my medical history every time I see a new doctor.” Ready access to health information, he says, is improving accessible healthcare not only in metro communities like his, but right across the country. Accessible healthcare in one of Australia’s largest – and most remote – regions For pharmacist Hannah Mann, remote Australia is home. She calls herself a “product of successful student placements” and, for 20 years, she’s been helping to supply medicines and other pharmaceutical services to people in northern Western Australia. Based in Broome, Mann works with Aboriginal health services such as Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service (KAMS), a member-based Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation. Every day, she dispenses prescriptions and offers pharmaceutical advice for people with vastly differing needs and in varied cultural contexts. “The big thing is the distance,” she says. “The Kimberley is massive; our service looks after patients across an area twice the size of Victoria.” The Kimberley covers 420,000 sq km, and Mann supports people in regional cities to residents of remote First Nations communities to visiting tourists. “Just geographically, supplying medications and services over that distance is always going to be a challenge,” she says. “That’s why any form of digital solution is a step in the right direction for us. Any way we can make information available in real time to everyone involved in the care of a patient, we make it better and safer.” Digital tools break down barriers to better care Mann started her career at a time when prescriptions and health records came via fax or in the post. Vital medical information could be lost, missed or simply not arrive in time. Now, digital tools such as My Health Record, my health app, electronic prescribing and the Active Script List allow health information to be stored securely online and accessed from anywhere. Hannah Mann. Photo credit: Abby Murray. “We upload something to My Health Record and the healthcare provider and the record’s owner can see it straight away,” Mann says. “It’s confidential and it’s private – and they can choose to share that information.” The impact this has on a region such as the Kimberley, she says, is significant. In tourist season, travellers frequently leave behind critical scripts and medical details, while remote patients rely on infrequent visits from specialists who don’t always have up-to-date records. With digital health tools, these issues become a thing of the past. Safe, secure and centralised healthcare records also make it easier for remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to stay on Country and access culturally appropriate care. “We know ‘one size fits all’ doesn’t work for everyone,” Mann says. “Peo",,Australian Digital Health Agency: Well connected,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.182295Z,news
31d9fa0da695d6bd48634f4bfbd63d9a,Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on technology-driven growth,2025-10-13T12:10:14Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/13/nobel-economics-prize-technology-joel-mokyr-philippe-aghion-peter-howitt,"Three experts in the power of technology to drive economic growth have been awarded this year’s Nobel prize in economics. Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University secured half of the 11m Swedish kronor (£867,000) prize, with the rest split between two other academics: Philippe Aghion of the Collège de France, Insead business school and the London School of Economics; and Peter Howitt of Brown University. Announcing the prize against a backdrop of rapid development in artificial intelligence and fierce debate over its impact on society and living standards, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the trio had pioneered the explanation of “innovation-driven economic growth”. The award came as countries worldwide push to turn around years of lacklustre economic growth since the 2008 financial crisis, amid concerns over a slowdown in productivity gains, sluggish progress on raising living standards, and mounting political tensions. Aghion, a French economist, warned that “dark clouds” were gathering amid increasing barriers to trade and openness fuelled by Donald Trump’s trade wars. He also said innovation in green industries, and blocking the rise of giant tech monopolies would be vital to stronger growth in future. “I’m not welcoming the protectionist wave in the US, and that’s not good for world growth and innovation,” he said. Speaking as he accepted the prize, he said AI had “fantastic growth potential” but called on governments to develop strict competition policies to manage the growth of new tech companies. “Some superstar firms may end up dominating everything and inhibiting potential entry of new innovators. So how can we make sure that today’s innovators will not stifle future entry and innovation?” The prize committee said technological developments had helped to power sustained economic growth over the past two centuries, but warned that future gains could not be taken for granted. Mokyr, a Dutch-born American-Israeli economic historian, won the prize for his research identifying the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress. Aghion and Howitt, a Canadian economist, shared the award for their analysis of how “creative destruction” is key for driving growth. “We must uphold the mechanisms that underlie creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,” said John Hassler, the chair of the committee for the prize in economic sciences. Established in the 1960s, several decades after the original Nobel prizes, it is technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. • The subheading of this article was amended on 17 October 2025.

8f6bc9fc791ccbebaa3f8197049040fb,England in talks to replace controversial Snicko with new technology for fourth Ashes Test,2025-12-18T19:00:38Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/18/england-in-talks-to-replace-controversial-snicko-with-new-technology-for-fourth-ashes-test,"The England and Wales Cricket Board has held talks with Cricket Australia about the possibility of replacing the decision review system (DRS) technology Snicko with an alternative UltraEdge for the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne after controversy on the opening two days of the Adelaide Test. In bilateral series, DRS technology is the responsibility of the home board, which in practice is passed on to the main domestic broadcast rights holder, in this case Fox Sports. However, the Guardian has learned that Cricket Australia’s free-to-air rights holder, Channel 7, has a DRS contract with Hawk-Eye Innovations, the company behind UltraEdge, so there is an alternative available should the hosts seek to make a change amid unhappiness from players on both sides. Mitchell Starc was overheard on the stump mic calling for Snicko to be “sacked” in the afternoon session on day two at Adelaide, with Australia’s players convinced Jamie Smith had gloved a catch to Usman Khawaja at slip, though replays showed the ball had not carried. The England wicketkeeper was then given out on review for an edge on another Pat Cummins short ball, even though the audio spike shown by Snicko did not match up with the pictures shown to the third umpire. On the first day, Alex Carey escaped after nicking to Smith off Josh Tongue on 72 after an operator error produced an unreliable sound wave showing a gap between the noise and the ball passing the bat. As primary rights holders, Fox has appointed the tech company BBG Sports to operate DRS using Snicko, whereas in England Sky Sports uses the UltraEdge system pioneered by Hawk-Eye Innovations, which is owned by Sony. Hawk-Eye’s contract with Channel 7 is understood to have led to discussions over a possible mid-series switch. While BBG’s Snicko is being used for the Ashes, Hawk-Eye’s UltraEdge is used in Australia in the Big Bash League so the technology is available if an agreement can be reached. Cricket Australia and Fox would need to reach a financial settlement with BBG. The ECB is understood to be involved in the discussions, but the final decision rests elsewhere. BBG issued a statement accepting responsibility for the Carey error at the close of day one, but did not respond to the controversies on day two. Speaking to the Australian radio station SEN before the start of the second day’s play, Cricket Australia’s chief executive, Todd Greenberg, expressed his unhappiness with BBG’s handling of the Carey incident. “There’s supposed to be a fail-safe with the technology and it didn’t happen. In my view that’s not good enough,” he said. “We’re asking a lot of questions of the providers through the broadcasters and hoping to get some answers so we can be assured it won’t happen again.” Before play, England also took the matter to the match referee, Jeff Crowe, who restored the review they had lost as a result of the Carey incident. Neither Cricket Australia nor the ECB commented at the end of day two.",Exclusive by Matt Hughes,Sport,en,2025-12-25T18:32:51.182403Z,news
ddbe7ea963ed38ba05cb82c153a96189,Trump’s AI infrastructure plans could face delays due to Texas Republicans,2025-04-15T10:00:39Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/trump-texas-ai-infrastructure-republicans,"Donald Trump’s plans to expand infrastructure to produce artificial intelligence in the US could face years of delays with the Republican-controlled Texas statehouse poised to pass legislation that imposes regulatory hurdles on data centers. The Trump administration earlier this year announced that a joint venture called Stargate would construct a total of 20 data centers to provide computing power for AI as part of an effort to help the US compete against China for leadership of the technology and spur investors to pursue AI projects. The companies behind Stargate – OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX, an investor backed by the United Arab Emirates, which together have pledged up to $500bn – chose Texas, with its loose regulation and pre-existing energy infrastructure for the first data center. But the construction of future data centers to support Trump’s AI agenda faces headwinds as a result of the Texas legislation SB6, which introduces new regulatory measures including a six-month review process in addition to the existing 6-18 month evaluation period with the goal of protecting its own power grid in the face of storms. The effects of the proposed bill are two-pronged: the regulatory measures could result in a maximum 24-month approval process, while the requirement to pay additional fees to the Texas grid operator and install backup generators would dramatically raise construction costs. That could lead tech companies to scale back planned construction of data centers in the state, according to equity analysts. Stargate, for instance, has started building its first 10 data centers in Abilene, Texas, but it is unclear if the second set of 10 would be subject to the bill. And if tech companies do not build in Texas, they might not build the data centers at all, directly hampering Trump’s AI initiative. Other states, from Wyoming to Wisconsin to Tennessee, have courted those construction projects, but lack the infrastructure that exists in Texas. “These heavy-handed mandates risk stifling investment on exactly the infrastructure needed for Trump’s AI initiative,” said Vance Ginn, who was the associate director of economic policy at the White House office of management and budget in Trump’s first term and is based in Texas. The bill, which is one of the legislative priorities of the Texas lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, and has already passed the Texas state senate, is aimed at avoiding a repeat of the effects of Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which knocked out power for days, leaving millions without heat. The storm, during which at least 246 people died, exposed reliability issues with the state’s energy grid. “Senate Bill 6 actually ensures President Trump’s Stargate Plan is a success,” Patrick said in an emailed statement. “We have made clear we are in lockstep with the President on his goal to make America number one, and dominate China on AI, data centers, and cryptocurrency. “These industries understand they will have to supply their own power needs and are diligently working toward that goal so costs are not disproportionally shifted onto residential and small business customers,” Patrick said, noting that Trump endorsed him for re-election as recently as Thursday. Republicans currently control the Texas state legislature and even critics of the bill acknowledge that another widespread power outage is perhaps the one political issue that has the potential to undercut the GOP majorities. Several government officials and those who controlled the power grid were fired or replaced after the failure. But the prospect of greater regulatory hurdles, coupled with the global slowdown in computing infrastructure development and the additional macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from increased construction costs related to Trump’s tariff plan, may have far-reaching ramifications. Microsoft has already abandoned a number of data center projects in the US that included lease cancellations and deferrals, according to a research note from analysts at TD Cowen, although Microsoft said it was still on track to invest $80bn in data centers in its fiscal year that ends in June. The Alibaba chairman, Joe Tsai, last month also warned of a potential bubble with data centers, suggesting new projects may exceed demand for AI services. Meanwhile, Trump’s measures currently impose a 10% tariff on all imports and a new 125% tariff on imports from China announced on Wednesday. Many components used in data centers, from raw materials like steel to goods such as electrical transformers, are produced outside the US. The investments into AI come as DeepSeek, a disruptive new Chinese company, emerged seemingly out of nowhere in January and released a series of AI models that were developed in a fraction of the time of those made by US companies, causing alarm in Silicon Valley over the broader global AI arms race.",Hugo Lowell,US news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:52.119721Z,news
9a2ac9a84f0c832298aca4010556147d,Meet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI,2025-11-22T14:00:40Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/22/ai-workers-tell-family-stay-away,"Krista Pawloski remembers the single defining moment that shaped her opinion on the ethics of artificial intelligence. As an AI worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk – a marketplace that allows companies to hire workers to perform tasks like entering data or matching an AI prompt with its output – Pawloski spends her time moderating and assessing the quality of AI-generated text, images and videos, as well as some factchecking. Roughly two years ago, while working from home at her dining room table, she took up a job designating tweets as racist or not. When she was presented with a tweet that read “Listen to that mooncricket sing”, she almost clicked on the “no” button before deciding to check the meaning of the word “mooncricket”, which, to her surprise, was a racial slur against Black Americans. “I sat there considering how many times I may have made the same mistake and not caught myself,” said Pawloski. The potential scale of her own errors and those of thousands of other workers like her made Pawloski spiral. How many others had unknowingly let offensive material slip by? Or worse, chosen to allow it? After years of witnessing the inner workings of AI models, Pawloski decided to no longer use generative AI products personally and tells her family to steer clear of them. “It’s an absolute no in my house,” said Pawloski, referring to how she doesn’t let her teenage daughter use tools like ChatGPT. And with the people she meets socially, she encourages them to ask AI about something they are very knowledgable in so they can spot its errors and understand for themselves how fallible the tech is. Pawloski said that every time she sees a menu of new tasks to choose from on the Mechanical Turk site, she asks herself if there is any way what she’s doing could be used to hurt people – many times, she says, the answer is yes. A statement from Amazon said that workers can choose which tasks to complete at their discretion and review a task’s details before accepting it. Requesters set the specifics of any given task, such as allotted time, pay and instruction levels, according to Amazon. “Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace that connects businesses and researchers, called requesters, with workers to complete online tasks, such as labeling images, answering surveys, transcribing text or reviewing AI outputs,” said Montana MacLachlan, an Amazon spokesperson. Pawloski isn’t alone. A dozen AI raters, workers who check an AI’s responses for accuracy and groundedness, told the Guardian that, after becoming aware of the way chatbots and image generators function and just how wrong their output can be, they have begun urging their friends and family not to use generative AI at all – or at least trying to educate their loved ones on using it cautiously. These trainers work on a range of AI models – Google’s Gemini, Elon Musk’s Grok, other popular models, and several smaller or lesser-known bots. One worker, an AI rater with Google who evaluates the responses generated by Google Search’s AI Overviews, said that she tries to use AI as sparingly as possible, if at all. The company’s approach to AI-generated responses to questions of health, in particular, gave her pause, she said, requesting anonymity for fear of professional reprisal. She said she observed her colleagues evaluating AI-generated responses to medical matters uncritically and was tasked with evaluating such questions herself, despite a lack of medical training. At home, she has forbidden her 10-year-old daughter from using chatbots. “She has to learn critical thinking skills first or she won’t be able to tell if the output is any good,” the rater said. “Ratings are just one of many aggregated data points that help us measure how well our systems are working, but do not directly impact our algorithms or models,” a statement from Google reads. “We also have a range of strong protections in place to surface high quality information across our products.” Bot watchers sound the alarm These people are part of a global workforce of tens of thousands who help chatbots sound more human. When checking AI responses, they also try their best to ensure that a chatbot doesn’t spout inaccurate or harmful information. When the people who make AI seem trustworthy are those who trust it the least, however, experts believe it signals a much larger issue. “It shows there are probably incentives to ship and scale over slow, careful validation, and that the feedback raters give is getting ignored,” said Alex Mahadevan, director of MediaWise at Poynter, a media literacy program. “So this means when we see the final [version of the] chatbot, we can expect the same type of errors they’re experiencing. It does not bode well for a public that is increasingly going to LLMs for news and information.” AI workers said they distrust the models they work on because of a consistent emphasis on rapid turnaround time at the expense of quality.

85929748d483e9130bbe109d904cd146,OpenAI signs $38bn cloud computing deal with Amazon,2025-11-03T18:09:38Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/03/openai-cloud-computing-deal-amazon-aws-datacentres-nvidia-chips,"OpenAI has signed a $38bn (£29bn) deal to use Amazon infrastructure to operate its artificial intelligence products, as part of a more than $1tn spending spree on computing power. The agreement with Amazon Web Services means OpenAI will be able to use AWS datacentres, and the Nvidia chips inside them, immediately. Last week, OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, said his company had committed to spending $1.4tn on AI infrastructure, amid concerns over the sustainability of the boom in using and building datacentres. These are the central nervous systems of AI tools such as ChatGPT. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” Altman said on Monday. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” OpenAI said the deal would give it access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its AI models. Amazon plans to use the chips in data clusters that will power ChatGPT’s responses and train OpenAI’s next wave of models, the companies said. Matt Garman, the chief executive of AWS, said OpenAI continued to push the boundaries of what was possible and that Amazon’s infrastructure would serve as a backbone for its ambitions. OpenAI is committed to developing 30 gigawatts of computing resources – enough to power roughly 25 million US homes. Last week, OpenAI said it had converted its main business into a for-profit corporation as part of a reorganisation that valued the startup at $500bn. Its longtime backer Microsoft will have a roughly 27% stake in OpenAI’s new for-profit corporation. The race for computing power by AI companies has raised concerns among some market watchers about how it will be paid for. OpenAI’s annual revenue is about $13bn, according the Financial Times, a figure dwarfed by its $1.4tn infrastructure commitment. Other datacentre deals signed by OpenAI include a $300bn agreement with the US company Oracle. Altman hit back at the spending concerns during a podcast appearance with the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, saying “enough” to a question from the host, the US investor Brad Gerstner, about the gap between OpenAI’s revenue and its infrastructure commitments. Altman said OpenAI made “well more” revenue than the reported $13bn, without specifying a number. He added: “I just – enough … I think there’s are a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares.” Analysts at the US investment bank Morgan Stanley estimate that global spending on datacentres will reach nearly $3tn between now and 2028. They said half of that spending would be covered by the big US tech companies and the rest would come from sources such as the private credit market, a growing part of the shadow banking sector that is raising concerns at the Bank of England and elsewhere.",Dan Milmo Global technology editor,Technology,en,2025-12-25T18:32:52.119864Z,news
e53004382d94d6e2f7d607035807fdbc,Asio accuses Chinese hackers of seeking access to Australia’s critical infrastructure ,2025-11-11T23:08:38Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/12/asio-accuses-chinese-hackers-of-seeking-access-to-australias-criticial-infrastructure,"Australia’s intelligence agency has accused “Chinese hackers” of seeking to gain access to critical infrastructure assets, including telecommunications networks. In a speech to a business forum in Melbourne, the director general of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, Mike Burgess, said the nation now faced a threat of “high-impact sabotage”. Burgess referenced the activities of two hacking units known as Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, which he said were “working for the Chinese government and their military”. He said the groups had successfully targeted the United States. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “Salt Typhoon’s intent was espionage – they penetrated the United States’ telecommunications system to gain access to the nation’s communications through a strategic spying operation,” Burgess said. “We have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well.” Burgess said Volt Typhoon’s intent was to compromise American critical infrastructure networks to “pre-position for potential sabotage”. “The penetrations gave China the ability to turn off telecommuncations and other critical infrastructure,” Burgess said. “And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well.” Burgess did not say which Chinese units had allegedly targeted Australian infrastructure and whether they had gained access. “Once access is gained – the network is penetrated – what happens next is a matter of intent not capability,” Burgess said. “I don’t think we – and I mean all of us – truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating this could be.” Burgess said targeted infrastructure assets among western allies also included transport, water and energy networks. The Chinese embassy was contacted for a response. The Chinese infiltration of US telecommunications systems late last year by Salt Typhoon was described as the worst hack in American history. The hack infiltrated dozens of US telecoms companies and implicated the data of senior political figures – including the president-elect, Donald Trump; the incoming vice-president, JD Vance; and Kamala Harris, the defeated Democratic presidential candidate. Earlier this year, Burgess said the “espionage-enabled sabotage of critical infrastructure” could cost the Australian economy more than $1bn. He estimated the cost could rise to $6bn if the disruption lasted for one week. Burgess also outlined previously unreported instances of alleged espionage targeting Australian corporations. The director general accused unnamed “nation state hackers” of stealing commercially sensitive information from a major Australian exporter, providing a significant advantage in subsequent contract negotiations. “In another case, they stole the blueprints of an Australian innovation and mass-produced cheap knock-offs that nearly bankrupted the innovator,” Burgess said. “A visiting academic with links to a foreign government broke into a restricted technology laboratory and filmed its contents.” Burgess also told the forum, organised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that his agency was “tracking a troubling increase in anarchist and revolutionary extremism, often targeting industry”. “Since October ’23, anti-Israel activists have increasingly used disruptive tactics such as arson, vandalism and violent protests targeting companies accused of providing weapons components,” Burgess said. “Rapid advances in technology are incubating and accelerating these security concerns.”",Henry Belot,Australia news,en,2025-12-25T18:32:52.119920Z,news

I rarely put literal pen to paper any more and it seems my overreliance on a keyboard means I may have lost the ability to write legible cursive. I’m not alone: handwriting is disappearing. It’s possible my kid will never be taught joined-up writing at school. While typing is more efficient, studies suggest typing notes rather than writing may have a negative impact on the brain’s ability to learn. A keyboard feels like stone age technology now; as AI becomes more embedded in our lives, what impact will that have on our brains? We’re still figuring that out. The people who make money from the tech keep telling us we need it, or we’ll fall behind. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, recently said if you don’t wear AI-powered smart glasses, you will find yourself at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” in the near future. However, a recent study suggests an overreliance on ChatGPT could harm critical thinking abilities. And then, of course, there’s all the other collateral damage of AI – from its massive environmental impact to its exploitation of underpaid creatives’ labour. Not everyone is keen on participating in this brave new world. Meet the “AI vegans”: people who have chosen to abstain from using AI for environmental, ethical and personal wellness reasons. Yes, “AI veganism” is a real phrase. No, I didn’t make it up. Although I rather wish I did, because it’s quite catchy, isn’t it? Side note: one of the most genius rebrands of all time was the way fake leather (which is often made from polyurethane, a type of plastic) suddenly became aspirational “vegan leather”. Will AI veganism catch on? Who knows. But, just like regular veganism, I’m sure its practitioners will tell you about it. And while it may be unrealistic to expect the masses to go digitally vegan, it’s not a bad idea for us all to be more cognisant of how much AI we consume and its impact on the planet. Perhaps any request to AI apps should be met with a digital calorie count first? Yes, I can generate a picture of a cat in a spaceship eating a taco, but my AI model might guzzle a bottle of water to do so and 10 times more energy than a Google search … do you really want that picture? Just some food for thought. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",Arwa Mahdawi,Opinion,en,2025-12-25T18:32:52.120029Z,news
0d9bf2345b88cfa7071d5aa6256cc72e,AI poses unprecedented threats. Congress must act now,2025-12-02T12:00:31Z,The Guardian,API,https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/artificial-intelligence-threats-congress,"Artificial intelligence and robotics will transform the world. It will bring unimaginable changes to our economy, our politics, warfare, our emotional wellbeing, our environment, and how we educate and raise our children. Further, there is a very real fear that, in the not-so-distant future, a super-intelligent AI could replace humans in controlling the planet. Despite the extraordinary importance of this issue and the speed at which it is progressing, AI is getting far too little discussion in Congress, the media and within the general population. That has got to change. Now. Several months ago, as the ranking member of the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, I undertook an investigation regarding the monumental challenges that we face with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Recently, I held a public discussion with Nobel prize winner Dr Geoffrey Hinton, considered to be the “Godfather” of AI, to get his views on a wide range of AI-related subjects. Based on our investigation and other information that we are gathering, my staff and I will soon be presenting a very specific set of recommendations to Congress as to how we can begin addressing some of the unprecedented threats that AI poses. Here are some of the outstanding questions that we intend to answer in our report: Who should be in charge of the transformation into an AI world? Currently, a handful of the very wealthiest people on Earth – Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel and others – are investing many hundreds of billions of dollars in developing and implementing AI and robotics. Are we comfortable with seeing these enormously powerful men shape the future of humanity without any democratic input or oversight? Is the goal of the AI revolution simply to make the very rich even richer and more powerful, or will this revolutionary technology be utilized to benefit all of humanity? Why does Donald Trump, who is strongly supporting the big tech oligarchs, want to impose an executive order blocking states from regulating artificial intelligence? Why does Thiel, the billionaire investor and co-founder of Palantir, call those who want regulations over AI “legionnaires of the Antichrist”. Does this elite group of big tech billionaires believe that they have “the divine right to rule”? How far will they go to resist government regulation? What impact will AI and robotics have on our economy and the lives of working people? The report I released last month found that AI, automation and robotics could replace nearly 100m jobs in America over the next decade, including 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants and 89% of fast-food workers, among many other occupations. Musk recently said: “AI and robots will replace all jobs. Working will be optional.” Gates predicted that humans “won’t be needed for most things”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI could lead to the loss of half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. If AI and robotics eliminate millions of jobs and create massive unemployment, how will people survive if they have no income? How do they feed their families or pay for housing or healthcare? Is government doing anything to prepare for this potential disaster? What impact will AI have on our democracy? At a time when the foundations of democracy are under attack in the US and throughout the world, will AI and robotics help make us a freer society or will it give even more power to the oligarchs who control the technology. Will AI result in a massive invasion of our privacy and civil liberties? Larry Ellison, the second richest person on Earth, predicted an AI-powered surveillance state where “citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on.” Are we reaching the stage where every phone call that we make, every email and text that we send, every bit of research we do on the internet will be available to the owners of AI? How do we sustain a democracy under those conditions? How do we protect privacy? Could AI literally redefine what it means to be a human being? Who we are, and how we develop emotionally and intellectually, is highly dependent upon our relationships with other human beings – our parents, family, teachers, lovers, friends and co-workers. To quote the 17th-century poet John Donne: “No man is an island / Entire of itself.” The human beings with whom we interact help shape us to become the people we are. But AI is changing that. According to a recent poll by Common Sense Media, 72% of US teenagers say they have used AI for companionship, and more than half do so regularly. What does it mean for young people to form “friendships” with AI, and become increasingly isolated from other human beings? What happens when millions seek emotional support from a machine? What is the long-term impact upon our humanity when our most important re",Bernie Sanders,Opinion,en,2025-12-25T18:32:52.120083Z,news
